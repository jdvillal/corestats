Systats-rs allows you to visualize the utilization of your computer resources the same way in different platforms.


##
Currently, with systats-rs you can monitor:
*  CPU usage
*  Memory usage
*  Storage usage
*  Runnig processes

Individual process and GPU monitoring are not supported yet, but are on the way.

I'm also working on a mobile version. 

## Developed with Tauri

NodeJS and Rust-Cargo are required for building.

Install dependencies with
```
npm install
```
Then you can start the app in developing mode with
```
npm run tauri dev
```
Or build in release mode with
```
npm run tauri build
```

On linux, you might need to install other dependencies. Check https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux for more information.


## Further help

Please consider this as a proof of concept. This is not a production ready software and there a lot of things that can be improved, so use it at your own risk.

If you find a bug, please report it opening a new issue.

Also, ideas for new features and contributions are welcome.
